## 3. Detailed Component Design

### 3.1 Temporal Cloud Integration

#### 3.1.1 Workflow Definition
- **Workflow Type**: Long-running, stateful workflow
- **Execution Timeout**: 4 hours (configurable)
- **Task Queue**: `landing-zone-provisioning`
- **Retry Policy**: Exponential backoff with maximum 3 attempts per activity

#### 3.1.2 Activity Design Patterns
```python
@activity.defn
class LandingZoneActivity:
    def __init__(self):
        self.aws_session = boto3.Session()
        self.retry_config = RetryConfig(
            region_name='us-east-1',
            retries={'max_attempts': 3, 'mode': 'adaptive'}
        )
    
    async def execute_with_monitoring(self, operation: str, params: dict):
        activity.heartbeat(f"Starting {operation}")
        try:
            result = await self._execute_operation(operation, params)
            activity.heartbeat(f"Completed {operation}")
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            activity.logger.error(f"Failed {operation}: {str(e)}")
            raise
```

#### 3.1.3 State Management
- **Workflow State**: Persisted in Temporal Cloud
- **Activity State**: Stateless with idempotent operations
- **Compensation Logic**: Built-in rollback activities for failure scenarios

### 3.2 ECS Fargate Worker Architecture

```yaml
Cluster Specifications:
  Name: temporal-landing-zone-workers
  Capacity Providers: [FARGATE, FARGATE_SPOT]
  Default Strategy:

    - Scaling: FARGATE_SPOT for additional capacity
  
Task Definition:
  CPU: 1 vCPU (1024 units)
  Memory: 2 GB (2048 MB)
  Network Mode: awsvpc
  Execution Role: temporal-worker-execution-role
  Task Role: temporal-worker-task-role
```

#### 3.2.2 Auto Scaling Configuration
```yaml
Service Auto Scaling:
  Min Capacity: 2 tasks
  Max Capacity: 20 tasks
  Target Tracking:
    - Metric: CPU Utilization
    - Target: 70%

    - Scale In Cooldown: 600s
  
Step Scaling (Backup):
  - Scale Out: +2 tasks when CPU > 80% for 2 minutes
  - Scale In: -1 task when CPU < 40% for 5 minutes
```
